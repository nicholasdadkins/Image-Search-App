# Project-2-Adkins-GiphySearch
Nicholas Adkins

Adkins GIPHY Search uses the GIPHY search API to allow users to find images based on what they input. 

The user types into the search bar and clicks submit for the page to display images of the search gathered from the GIPHY site. 

HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as Tailwind are utilized. 
In the future I wish to be able to break up results into different categories, add a loading spinner to the calls, and include result counter.
